This Python script is a password strength checker. It ensures that a password meets certain criteria for complexity and length. Here's how it works:

1. The script defines five functions to check various aspects of a password:

* check_digit(pwd): Checks if the password contains at least one digit (0-9).
* check_uppercase(pwd): Checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
* check_lowercase(pwd): Checks if the password contains at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
* check_special_char(pwd): Checks if the password contains at least one special character (!@#$%^&*?).
* check_length(pwd): Checks if the password length is between 6 and 18 characters.

2. The user is prompted to input a password.

3. The script then checks if the password meets all the criteria using the all() function and a list comprehension containing calls to the above functions.

4. If the password meets all criteria, a message indicating that the password is strong is printed.

5. If the password fails to meet one or more criteria, the script prints a message listing the specific requirements that were not met.

Users can input their chosen password, and the script will provide feedback on whether the password meets the required complexity and length criteria.
